# MARKDOWN SYNTAX
__Markdown__ is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as __bold__ or _italic_, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.

## HEADERS
# This is an H1 tag
## This is an H2 tag
###### This is an H6 tag

## EMPHASIS
*This text will be italic* _This will also be italic_<br>
**This text will be bold** __This will also be bold__<br>
*You **can** combine them*

## BLOCKQUOTES
As Grace Hopper said:
> Iâ€™ve always been more interested 
> in the future than in the past.
